It includes many other substeps such as `tokenizing`, `case conversion`, `correcting spelling`, `removing stop words`, `stemming` and `lemmatization`.\n","\n","**Tokenization**: It is essentially splitting a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or an entire text document into smaller units, such as individual words or terms. Each of these smaller units are called tokens. Usually we split a text document by word to obtain a token for each individual word in a list of tokens.\n","\n","**Stop words**: A list of the most common words in a language\n","\n","**Vectorization**: The process of writing tokens of text data in the form of vectors, since computer programs are only able to understand numbers it is important to vectorize text data in order to process it. Also called `Feature extraction`; There are many feature-extraction methods the most famous being `bag of words based frequency features`.\n","\n","**Feature Matrix**: In this matrix each row represents a document (here tweet) and each column represents a feature (processed token). It is used by ML and statistical models to provide predictions.\n","\n","**Stemming**: Consists of extracting only the smallest uncompressable part of a word not containing any suffixes or prefixes or any other inflections. Then converting it to the root or the source of the meaning of that word.\n","\n","**lemmatization**: Similar to `Stemming` is the same process of removing inflections from a feature (token) but without converting it to its origin of meaning. It is less representative for making prediction since more words can have the same stem than the the words having the same lemma.\n","\n","**Bag of Words Model**: One of the most popular yet simple Feature Extraction methods, for each document we build a set of words without any regard of the order of presence (hence the name bag of words).

It could be because we're using Arabic language and scikit learn is unable to correctly tokenize words, it could be that the words that have the same root arent' considred as the same token. I will try to preprocess the data first to turn each tweet text into tokens. \n","    A problem that could arise is not being able to detect the order of words. I'm not sure if NLtk will scramble the words or will they be in the same order for us to be able to use n-gram of words later on."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"id":"1f43bfc5","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"96aef751-938c-4c7d-a529-014ba033a901","_uuid":"4de24fee-81c6-40ea-941f-0b00169a6a6e","collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-12T09:53:20.414977Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-12T09:53:20.414553Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-12T09:53:20.839514Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-12T09:53:20.837878Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"papermill":{"duration":0.442903,"end_time":"2023-01-12T09:53:20.842431","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-12T09:53:20.399528","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["0
