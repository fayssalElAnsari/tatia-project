Calculating Accuracy Score\n","Now we need to get a percentage of the accuracy of our model, we have a list of predicted sentiment and a list of the actual sentiment. Whenever predicted sentiment is different of the actual one we will increment a counter, after going through all the tweets we will divide but the total number of tweets to get a percentage of the wrong predictions, to get the percentage of the right prediction all we need to do is subtract the calculated score from 100%."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"a145d6e0","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"19c26993-64cb-49bb-b033-f7186a705740","_uuid":"afb6c115-b16d-4fb9-a060-ef68a1aa2bdf","collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-04T22:04:17.26655Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-04T22:04:17.265774Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-04T22:04:17.288808Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-04T22:04:17.287664Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"papermill":{"duration":0.038575,"end_time":"2023-01-04T22:04:17.292082","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-04T22:04:17.253507","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["validity score: 78.11631944444444%\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>sentiment</th>\n","      <th>content</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>pos</td>\n","      <td>الهلال_الاهلي فوز هلالي مهم الحمد لله  زوران ب...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>pos</td>\n","      <td>صباحك خيرات ومسرات</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>pos</td>\n","      <td>تأمل قال الله ﷻ  _بواد زرع _    ومع هتف بالدعا...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>pos</td>\n","      <td>جدعان الرجاله اللي ال دول خطر تويتر وربنا مش ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>pos</td>\n","      <td>رساله صباحيه   اللهم اسألك التوفيق امورنا واكت...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5763</th>\n","      <td>neg</td>\n","      <td>النوم وانت مكسور ده احساس غبي اللي مش قادر تنا...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5764</th>\n","      <td>neg</td>\n","      <td>استشهاد_الامام_كاظم_الغيظ السلام المعذب قعر ال...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5765</th>\n","      <td>neg</td>\n","      <td>انا كنت اكل الصحن بكبره</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5766</th>\n","      <td>neg</td>\n","      <td>قولوا ايش تشوفوا  ملاحظة التلطف لأنه المود</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5767</th>\n","      <td>neg</td>\n","      <td>أردت تعرف شيئا عني إسالني تسأل غيري فعشاق الت...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>11520 rows × 2 columns</p>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["     sentiment                                            content\n","0          pos  الهلال_الاهلي فوز هلالي مهم الحمد لله  زوران ب...\n","1          pos                                صباحك خيرات ومسرات \n","2          pos  تأمل قال الله ﷻ  _بواد زرع _    ومع هتف بالدعا...\n","3          pos   جدعان الرجاله اللي ال دول خطر تويتر وربنا مش ...\n","4          pos  رساله صباحيه   اللهم اسألك التوفيق امورنا واكت...\n","...        ...                                                ...\n","5763       neg  النوم وانت مكسور ده احساس غبي اللي مش قادر تنا...\n","5764       neg  استشهاد_الامام_كاظم_الغيظ السلام المعذب قعر ال...\n","5765       neg                           انا كنت اكل الصحن بكبره \n","5766       neg        قولوا ايش تشوفوا  ملاحظة التلطف لأنه المود \n","5767       neg   أردت تعرف شيئا عني إسالني تسأل غيري فعشاق الت...\n","\n","[11520 rows x 2 columns]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["wrong_predictions = 0\n","validity_score = 0\n","for predicted_sentiment, actual_sentiment in zip(predicted, X_test.sentiment):\n","    if predicted_sentiment != actual_sentiment:\n","        wrong_predictions += 1\n","wrong_predictions_percentage = wrong_predictions / len(X_test.sentiment)\n","validity_score = 1 -
